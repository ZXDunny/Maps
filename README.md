# Maps
Repository of my game maps

This is just a place to keep my maps online should anything happen to Pavero's generous hosting of them. I retain the copyright of course, but otherwise feel free to do what you want with them. They hail from the heady days of the early 2000s when we were young and writing emulators. I'd just added a screenshot facility to ZXSpin, so was messing around with it.
